**WarmeY2K** is a fully free **2D/3D** game engine dedicated to **indie games** !      
It provide an easy way to build web based "old-school" games like the **PS1/PS2/XBOX** era in a modern **Typescript & HTML5, CSS3** environement. The core engine is freely available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/warme-y2k) or starter-kit. You can also have full access to the [documentation](http://warme-engine.com/).

Some words about our philosophy:
- **Robustness:** We used only simple and efficient methods coming from the industrie for nearly two decades.     
- **Flexibility:** Create your own renderers. Handle render and update loops in a state-less way.    
- **Modularity:** We used modular architecture to keep things simple and separate.     
- **Performance:** We used WebGPU API for a blazing fast rendering.
- **Lightweight:** The lib minzipped size is just 73 kB (1Mb with Rapier2D & Rapier3D).

For a more concret overview on it, you can play [examples](http://demo.warme-engine.com/).
